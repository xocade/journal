### cursor movement
`h` -- left 
`j` -- down 
`k` -- up 
`l` -- right 

`w` -- move to the next word 
`e` -- move to the end of the word 
`b` -- move one word backward

```vim
3b
```
would move the cursor 3 words backward.

`H` - move to top of screen
`M` - move to middle of screen
`L` - move to bottom of screen
`W` - jump forwards to the start of a word (words can contain punctuation)
`E` - jump forwards to the end of a word (words can contain punctuation)

# vi Editor

### cursor movement
`h` -- left 
`j` -- down 
`k` -- up 
`l` -- right 

`w` -- move to the next word 
`e` -- move to the end of the word 
`b` -- move one word backward

vi commands' effects can be multiplied by preceding them with the numbers as the amount desired. E.g.,
```vim
3b
```
would move the cursor 3 words backward.

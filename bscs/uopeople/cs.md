## Subjects to Study

|Subject|Why study?|Book|Videos|
|---|---|---|---|
|**[Programming](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming)**|Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion.|_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_|Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A|
|**[Computer Architecture](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#architecture)**|If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.|_Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective_|Berkeley CS 61C|
|**[Algorithms and Data Structures](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms)**|If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems.|_The Algorithm Design Manual_|Steven Skiena’s lectures|
|**[Math for CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#math)**|CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.|_Mathematics for Computer Science_|Tom Leighton’s MIT 6.042J|
|**[Operating Systems](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#operating-systems)**|Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.|_Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_|Berkeley CS 162|
|**[Computer Networking](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#networking)**|The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.|_Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach_|Stanford CS 144|
|**[Databases](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#databases)**|Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.|_Readings in Database Systems_|Joe Hellerstein’s Berkeley CS 186|
|**[Languages and Compilers](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#languages)**|If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily.|_Crafting Interpreters_|Alex Aiken’s course on edX|
|**[Distributed Systems](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#distributed-systems)**|These days, _most_ systems are distributed systems.|_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ by Martin Kleppmann|MIT 6.824|
